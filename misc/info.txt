Hello! I can't work with Relay store when creating and deleting records via the updater function. The mutations themselves work, but the UI is not updated. I have done so much already, and only this topic does not work out in any way. I don't know what to do anymore. If someone help me figure it out, I will be very grateful. The project is in the repository. This application is a full stack, all processes (server, compiler, react) are started by one command (npm run start), there is a "fake" server in which we can create and delete records. Only updater/optimisticUpdater does not work. Here is the link:

Thanks everyone!
